<challenge>
The attached dataset contains information about customers and restaurant ratings. The task is open-ended and an opportunity to showcase your strengths. You can use any programming language and any tool to showcase your results.

What insights can you gather? How can you visualise the data? Examples of things you could investigate: Is there a difference in cuisine preference between males and females? Different age groups?

Also think about how you could use a Machine Learning algorithm to predict the ratings of the customers in the dataset, and how you would use the dataset to evaluate your model.
