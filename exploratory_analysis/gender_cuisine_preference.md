In the graph grid "gender_cuisine_preference.png", each graph represents the distribution between max_ratings (customers who rated a restaurant "excellent") and min_ratings (customers who rated a restaurant "dislike") between genders for each cuisine type.

A few considerations:

- African Cuisine: Men tend to appreciate this cuisine more than women, being that no woman gave an African Restaurant the maximum rating and the ratio of women rating as "dislike" is double the ratio of men rating "dislike".

- Bars & Pubs: Men also tend to appreciate this cuisine more than women. This may be related to the environment and also the food choices. The data supports this as it shows that men rate this cuisine type as "excellent" twice as much as women, with about half the "dislikes".

- Vegetarian & Vegan: Women showed a greater appreciation for this cuisine, given that they rate it as "excellent" over 3 times more often than men. The ratio of men rating it as "dislike" is also twice as high as their female counterpart.

- American & Breakfast/Brunch: Both genders rated American and Breakfast/Brunch as excellent a majority of the time, with no records of "dislike" ratings. This could support a hypothesis of a sampling bias.
